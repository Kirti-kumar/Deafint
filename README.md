# Deafint
Deafint an app which consists of a program that can help us communicate with specially abled people (deaf and
dumb). The aim of this app is to design a convenient system that is helpful to general people who are keen to learn
sign language and create an awareness for the cause. We aim to help the needy and oppressed through the resources that we
have. In this project we are using a combination of both Artificial intelligence and machine learning to successfully translate sign
language into a proper human readable language and vice versa, to implement this program in an app which we will construct
using python
